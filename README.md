Certainly! Here's a documentation for the digital clock code:

Digital Clock Documentation
Overview
This is a simple digital clock implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second.

Files
index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the clock.
style.css: Contains the CSS styles for the clock display.
script.js: Contains the JavaScript code to update and display the current time.
HTML Structure (index.html)
The HTML file defines the structure of the clock display. It consists of a div element with the class clock, which contains another div element with the class time. The time div is where the current time will be displayed.

CSS Styles (style.css)
The CSS file contains styles to enhance the appearance of the clock display. It applies styles to the body, clock, and time elements.

body: Sets the background color of the page and centers the clock vertically and horizontally.
.clock: Styles the outer container of the clock. It sets the background color, border-radius to create a circular shape, width, height, and box-shadow for a 3D effect.
.time: Styles the element where the time is displayed. It sets the font size and color.
JavaScript Code (script.js)
The JavaScript file contains code to update and display the current time on the clock.

updateTime(): This function retrieves the current time using the Date object, formats it as hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates the content of the time element.
setInterval(): Calls the updateTime() function every second to continuously update the clock display.
Initial Call: Immediately calls the updateTime() function to display the current time when the page loads.
Usage
To use the digital clock:

Ensure all three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are in the same directory.
Open index.html in a web browser.
The clock will display the current time and update every second.
Customization
You can modify the CSS styles in styles.css to change the appearance of the clock (e.g., colors, sizes, fonts).
Advanced features, such as adding date display or time formatting options, can be implemented in the JavaScript code
